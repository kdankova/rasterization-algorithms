# Raster Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of various raster algorithms in Python. These algorithms are commonly used in computer graphics and image processing for drawing lines and circles on a raster display.

Feel free to test it [here](https://rasterization-algorithms.streamlit.app)!

## Algorithms Included

1. DDA (Digital Differential Analyzer)
2. Bresenham's Line Drawing Algorithm
3. Bresenham's Circle Drawing Algorithm
4. CDA (Coordinate Digital Analyzer)

Each algorithm is implemented as a separate function and can be easily utilized for drawing lines and circles on a raster display.
